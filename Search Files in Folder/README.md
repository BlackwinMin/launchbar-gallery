# Search Files in Folder

20231218 For users who have Keyboard Maestro，there is a better version: [Seach in Current Folder](https://github.com/BlackwinMin/LaunchBar-gallery/tree/master/Seach%20in%20Current%20Folder).

This action has died in Big Sur, use [Search Files Here](https://github.com/BlackwinMin/LaunchBar-gallery/tree/master/Search%20Files%20Here) instead please.

Navigate to specific folder, type two spaces and keep typing tp search current folder in LaunchBar.
